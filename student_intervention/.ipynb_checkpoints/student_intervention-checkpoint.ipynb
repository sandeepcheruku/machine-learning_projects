This can be represented as graph. Now you can parse through the possible nodes and edges as per the condition rules (if condition1 and condition2 and condition3 then outcome). A decision tree is built top-down from a root node and involves partitioning the data into subsets that contain instances with similar values (homogenous).The algorithm tries to find the best split condition (quantified based on the impurity measure) and stops when no improvement is possible. Impurity measures defines how well are the classes separated.Entropy measures the homogeneity of a data set.If the sample is completely homogeneous the entropy is zero and if the sample is an equally divided, it has entropy of one. If the feature values are continous,threshold values are used in order to handle this real-valued data.A simple idea is to find the observed value which when treated as a theshold gives the best split.\n",
